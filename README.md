### Made in KiCad


I provide only KiCad files because different PCB fabs require different export methods
Just google "[your preffered pcb fab] KiCad guide"

This mod is tested and ready to use!
It installs onto the motherboard and then the cable that goes into the fan cage goes into the mod. This mod cannot be installed on the fan itself!
